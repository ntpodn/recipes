    5 egg whites
    225g caster sugar
    1tbsp cornflour
    1tbsp vanilla essence
    500ml double/whipping cream
    200g fresh fruits (passion-fruit, mango, peaches)
	
	Line a large flat baking tray with baking paper and preheat the oven to 160 degrees. 
	Create a 9-10inch circle with a pencil on the baking paper to create an outlin for the pavlova.
	
	Get a grease free bowl and place the egg whites in. 
	Using an electric hand whisk, whisk the egg whites until firn and hold shape.
	
	Then add all the caster sugar and carry on whisking untill glossy. 
	Half way through, in a seprate bowl combine the cornflour and vanilla essence 
	to form a coffee looking paste and to the raw meringue mixture. 
	Carry on whisking until the the meringue is glossy and leaves ribbons on the top without sinking.
	
	Then start to form the mixture based around the circle on the tray and layer it up from the egdes to create dip in the middle. 
	Then place in the oven and turn the heat down to 150 degrees. Cook for 1 hour 15 minutes.
	DO NOT open the oven intervals. Leave the pavlova to cook until pale and firn to touch. 
	Cool in the oven with the door shut for 30 minutes to leave the pavlova mallowy inside.
	While cooling, whip up the cream until thick and slice the fruit neatly.
	Once the pavlova has cooled arrange the cream over the pavlova in the dip. 
	Then scatter with the fruit. Leave in the fridge for 1 hour before serving.
